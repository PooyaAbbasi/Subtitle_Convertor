## Sample program convert a .vtt subtitle file to .srt through CLI.

Clone the project and run UI.py with python 3.11, No more requirements is needed. 
By executing UI.py on your device, it'll get the full path of a vtt subtitle file in your device,
and make a srt one of that and save it in the very path.

This program used python and ReGexs to perform convertion.

### Why I created this?
As the KMPlayer 64x doesn't work with vtt subtitle files I wrote this program to convert vtt files to srt in no time,
so I can use subtitles by KMPlayer.
Also I want to write a sample project as a python begginer.
