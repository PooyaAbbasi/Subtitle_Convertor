1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
Congratulations, you've reached

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,920
the end of this
module on models.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,935
In this module, you've
learned to create models,

4
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:11,310
apply migrations to
appropriate use cases using

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,070
best practice principles
and learned to use

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,940
the query set API to
interact with the database.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,540
Next, you discovered how
to create a form and

8
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,200
use the form API to
bind data to objects.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,245
You learned how to use
the Django admin panel to

10
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:31,500
add and control the permissions
of users and groups.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,220
Finally, unpacked how to set up

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,210
a MySQL database for
your Django app.

13
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,960
It's now time to recap

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,255
the key points and the
skills you've gained.

15
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:44,600
You began the module with
models and migrations.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,625
Here, you explored models,

17
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:48,980
fields, attributes, and keys.

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,800
You are now able to describe
the relationship and

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,745
similarities between models
and databases with tables,

20
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:59,315
and demonstrate how to
create models in Django,

21
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:01,670
focusing on the
different attributes.

22
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,500
Furthermore, you can now

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,870
summarize the concept
of migrations and

24
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,160
how they are beneficial in

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,889
web applications
through best practices,

26
00:01:09,889 --> 00:01:12,655
dealing with issues
and rolling back.

27
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,430
You can discuss how migrations
can save a lot of time for

28
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,395
development teams by separating

29
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:20,990
the SQL away from the coding.

30
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,655
There is no need to create

31
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:25,460
SQL queries directly
against the database,

32
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,020
or where to store

33
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,035
these files so that other
developers can run them.

34
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:34,370
Next, you explored Object
Relational Mapping, ORM,

35
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,530
and how jangle uses it to create

36
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,310
SQL queries against
the database.

37
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,055
You also discovered the
query set API and how

38
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:45,020
developers use it to save and

39
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,260
retrieve data in the database.

40
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,580
Following models and migrations,

41
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,860
you learned about
models and forums.

42
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,520
You were introduced to Django's
rich framework for forms

43
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,690
and how to manipulate

44
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,855
form data to extract
and send information.

45
00:01:59,855 --> 00:02:03,110
You are now able to showcase
setting up a model with

46
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,180
different data types and how

47
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,885
they are mapped from a
standard body request.

48
00:02:07,885 --> 00:02:11,060
You also exercised
creating forms by using

49
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,020
the forum API and some of
its inbuilt datatypes.

50
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,765
Next, you focused on admin.

51
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:19,730
This section introduced you to

52
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,865
the Django admin and some
of its core features.

53
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:24,470
You can demonstrate how to

54
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,510
create and manage
users and groups

55
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,490
directly from the admin panel to

56
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,235
provide access to the
web applications.

57
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,740
You also learned how
permissions work

58
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,940
at the view, model,

59
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,130
and controller
levels, and how they

60
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,025
can be added using the
Django admin view.

61
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:42,200
Lastly, you can set up

62
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,920
users and add or
revoke permissions.

63
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,765
Finally, you explore
database configuration.

64
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:50,690
You are now able to showcase

65
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,240
the different database
options that are available in

66
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,925
Django with MySQLite and
MySQL as the main focus.

67
00:02:57,925 --> 00:03:00,410
You practice the steps
needed to set up

68
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,570
the database configuration and

69
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,400
SQLite database for
local development.

70
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,970
Then you learned about
the configuration options

71
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,415
for setting up a
MySQL database and

72
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:13,670
exercised session of a
MySQL database connection

73
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,060
and testing that
it's up and running.

74
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,320
You're now familiar with models.

75
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,060
More specifically, you can

76
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,750
create models and
apply migrations.

77
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,140
You can also use

78
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,260
the query search API to
interact with the database

79
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,970
and create forums by leveraging

80
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,155
the form API to bind
data to objects.

81
00:03:32,155 --> 00:03:34,070
You familiarize yourself with

82
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,050
the Django admin panel to add

83
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,695
and control the permissions
of users and groups.

84
00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:41,345
Finally, you concluded
by setting up

85
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:43,985
a MySQL database for
your Django app.

86
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:46,085
Well done. You're making

87
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:49,680
excellent progress through
your Django development.
